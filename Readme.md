# üè• AWS Data Pipeline for Synthetic Healthcare Data (Synthea‚Ñ¢)

This repository contains a robust, end-to-end AWS-based data pipeline designed to ingest, process, transform, catalog, and analyze synthetic healthcare data generated by the open-source [Synthea‚Ñ¢](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) simulation platform.

---

## üéØ Pipeline Purpose and Goals

The pipeline converts raw Synthea data into clean, structured, query-optimized datasets for BI and analytics. It is built using **fully managed, serverless AWS services** to ensure:
- High scalability
- Minimal operational overhead
- Easy integration with BI tools like Power BI

## üèóÔ∏è Key Architecture Components

| Component            | AWS Service         | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|
| Raw Data Storage     | Amazon S3           | Store unprocessed CSVs from Synthea |
| Pre-processing       | AWS Glue (PySpark)  | Basic cleanup and normalization |
| ETL & Transformation | AWS Glue (PySpark)  | Deduplication, cleansing, conversion to Parquet |
| Metadata Cataloging  | AWS Glue Jobs       | Custom schema management (instead of crawlers) |
| Query Layer          | Amazon Athena       | Interactive SQL querying |
| Visualization        | Power BI            | Dashboards and reports |

---

## üîÅ Pipeline Workflow

### üß¨ Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data with Synthea

\`\`\`bash
# Run the Synthea simulation
./run_synthea -p 1000 -s 1749537673085
\`\`\`

- Output: CSV files like \`patients.csv\`, \`encounters.csv\`, etc. in the \`output/csv/\` folder.

### üì§ Step 2: Upload to S3

Upload files to your bucket using AWS CLI or SDK:

\`\`\`
s3://synthea001/resource_folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patients.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encounters.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conditions.csv
...
\`\`\`

## üß™ Pipeline Stages in Detail

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Raw Storage in Amazon S3

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| \`s3://synthea001/resource_folder/\`     | Raw data |
| \`s3://synthea001/cleaning_stage_1/\`    | After initial cleaning |
| \`s3://synthea001/cleaning_stage_2/\`    | Final cleaned Parquet files |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-processing with AWS Glue (Stage 1)

- Fix malformed rows (e.g., remove trailing commas)
- Drop redundant columns
- Add ingestion timestamps
- Output to:  
  \`s3://synthea001/cleaning_stage_1/<timestamp>/\`

‚è±Ô∏è *Exec time: ~15s per file*

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ETL & Parquet Conversion with Glue (Stage 2)

- Remove duplicates
- Standardize data types (e.g., age ‚Üí integer)
- Convert date strings ‚Üí timestamps
- Normalize column names
- Handle multivalued columns
- Apply **SCD Type 2** logic
- Output:  
  \`s3://synthea001/cleaning_stage_2/<timestamp>/\`

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger Crawler via Glue Job

- Glue Job triggers the crawler post-transformation
- Updates **Glue Data Catalog** for new Parquet data
- Enables Athena to query latest tables

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cataloging with AWS Glue Crawler

- Crawls: \`s3://synthea001/cleaning_stage_2/<timestamp>/\`
- Auto-detects schema, partitions
- Updates Glue Catalog Database
- Enables SQL access via Athena

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create Dimensions & Fact Table

- Create dimension tables: \`dim_patients\`, \`dim_encounters\`, etc.
- Add SCD2 fields (\`effective_date\`, \`end_date\`, \`is_current\`)
- Generate surrogate keys
- Join dimensions ‚Üí \`fact_patient_e\`
- Save everything in **Parquet** format

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Orchestration with AWS Step Functions

- Orchestrates:
  1. Preprocessing job
  2. Cleansing job
  3. Catalog update job
- Handles retries, failures
- Offers a visual state machine & audit trail

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization with Power BI + Athena

- Use Athena JDBC connector
- Connect Power BI directly to S3 via Athena
- No data movement required
- Serverless, scalable query performance
